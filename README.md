Python code to visualize and zoom in to the Mandelbrot set using a scroll wheel.


The Mandelbrot set is a mathematical set of points that is defined by a complex number system. It is named after the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, who studied and popularized it. The Mandelbrot set is often depicted as a colorful image, with the different colors representing different regions of the set. The set is famous for its intricate, self-similar structure, which has been studied extensively by mathematicians and computer scientists.
